# Auth0's application types for quickstart tutorials

[WIP] This is a repository for mapping all application types for quickstart tutorials by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

> WARNING: Updating this collection requires checking on [TutorialNavigator](https://github.com/auth0/tutorial-navigator) since it currently depends highly on naming and stuff of this repository.

## Release
